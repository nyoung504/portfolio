  <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p class="aboutp">My name is Nicole Young. I am orginally from New York and moved to Melbourne in October 2018. I tried to reflect my journey on the main page showing 
      an image of Sorrento Beach in Victoria, overlayed with an image of New York City. 
      I started my career in Banking at the Financial Times located on Wall Street. 
      Then I moved through big banking institutions like Bank of America and Deutsche Bank as a financial analyst. 
      I have worked at a Hedge Fund, then at a small boutique investment firm that closed. My last stop in New York was working as an engineering 
      intern for 5 months at Grasshopper Bank which was a start-up digital bank.<br>
      I have been  transitioning to a new country and into parenthood since I have arrived in Australia.
      I am now ready to continue on my path to become a web developer. Since moving to Australia, I have been eager to get back to coding. 
      The Coder Academy has been a great experience and I can't wait to put what I've learned to practice.<br></br>
